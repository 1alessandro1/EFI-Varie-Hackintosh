OC 0.6.7 EFI R002 BETA
   Config.plist changes

      - Kernel > Add: Removed RTCMemoryFixup.kext
      - NVRAM > Add > 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 > boot-args: removed rtcfx_exclude
   Kexts changes
      - Removed RTCMemoryFixup.kext
   ACPI changes
   - Replaced SSDT-AWAC-HPET with SSDT-AWAC-HPET-RTC which includes RTC patch (same as CLOVER's Fix RTC) which changes RTC memory length from 0x8 to 0x2 to prevent RTC memory corruption)

OC 0.6.7 EFI R001
   config.plist changes
   - Changed Booter>Quirks>ProtectUefiServices from No to Yes
   - Added PlatformInfo>Generic>MaxBIOSVersion = No
   - Added Kernel>Add entry for NVMeFix.kext
   - Added UEFI>Quirks>ActivateHpetSupport = No
    Removed UEFI>Input>KeyMergeThreshold
   - Changed Boot-Arg rtcfx_exclude=B0-B3,B7 to rtcfx_exclude=B0-B8.  This change did not resolve the RTC issue for the G4 Mini.

   Kext Updates
   - Change default USBPorts.kext to match USBPorts-NoHS14.kext (Kernel>Quirks>XhciPortLimit=False)
   - Updated AppleALC.kext 1.5.7 -> 1.5.8
   - Updated VirtualSMC.kext 1.2.0 -> 1.2.1
   - Updated WhateverGreen.kext 1.4.7 -> 1.4.8
   - Added NVMeFix.kext 1.0.5


This EFI update for Open Core 0.6.7 includes a USBPorts.kext that is equivalent to USBPorts-NoHS14.kext (also included in this EFI) to comply with the 15-port logical USB port limit (with Kernel>Quirks>XhciPortLimit=False).  This USBPorts.kext does not have port HS14 (the internal Bluetooth USB port).  We can no longer boot with more than 15 logical USB ports starting with Big Sur 11.3.  This EFI also includes USBPorts-16.kext that you can edit to customize your own USB port map.  USBPorts-16.kext includes all 16 of the available logical USB ports on the G3, G4 and G5 Minis.

Before using this EFI, replace the following PlatformInfo>Generic values in config.plist with your own (use https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS):
- MLB
- ROM
- SystemSerialNumber
- SystemUUID

This EFI enables the boot chime.  If you want OpenCore to load faster, disable UEFI>AudioSupport and delete the UEFI Audio driver (in config.plist).
